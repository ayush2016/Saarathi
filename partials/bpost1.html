            <hr>
            <p class="lead">Every year, thousands of men, women and children fall into the hands of traffickers, in their own countries and abroad. Almost every country in the world is affected by trafficking, whether as a country of origin, transit or destination for victims. Human Trafficking is a form of modern slavery where people profit from the control and exploitation of others. Exploitation includes, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs. Over the years, it has been found out that traffickers lure people into forced labor and sex trafficking by manipulating and exploiting their vulnerabilities. Our State, Assam is one of the most vulnerable states of India when it comes to Human Trafficking. <br/> The various reasons behind this vulnerability can be summed up as below:</p>

            <p class="lead"><strong>Supply Factors</strong>: Structural inequalities in society, ethnic conflicts, child marriage, unemployment, lure of job in big cities by fake placement agencies, natural calamities, fake marriage, increasing urbanization, lack of educational facilities; erosion in traditional values, large family size. </p>

            <p class="lead"><strong>Demand Factors</strong>: Migration of laborers from rural to urban areas, open border, sex tourism, internet pornography, demand for domestic help in metros, demand for girls for marriage in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.</p>

            <p class="lead"><strong>Perpetuating Factors</strong>: Geographical location of the state, low literacy rates, low conviction rates for human traffickers, weak and flawed law enforcement, lack of awareness about the issue and pre-occupation of the security forces with anti-militancy operation.</p>

            <p class="lead">Human trafficking has seeped into every nook and corner of our state. The government of Assam has continuously been criticized for their inability to control the rise in this phenomenon. The major impediment towards containing the problem of human trafficking is improper enforcement of laws along with the inadequate and ineffective policies and organizational structures. The situation has only gone from bad to worse over the years and Assam has turned into the trafficking capital of the country. Even the Supreme Court has come down heavily on the Tarun Gogoi government for its failure to trace the missing girls and children in the recent years. Some of the major steps adopted by the state government to deal with human trafficking in Assam include creation of Anti Human Trafficking Cells at CID headquarters, District Juvenile Justice Boards, District Child Welfare Committees, District Special Juvenile Police Unit, District Advisory Boards, District wise Observation homes and Shelter Homes, Training and Sensitization on Human Trafficking for officers and men and many more. Other steps include Investigation of Crime against Women to be prioritized at PS/OP level, optimum vigilance in Railway stations/ bus stops which are prone to movement of human trafficking, prompt enquiry/verification to ascertain incidents of trafficking from those of kidnapping, abduction, missing entries, Senior Police Officers to conduct effective raids by taking assistance of NGOs connected in anti trafficking and identification of Organized rackets and its members for firm legal action. Apart from that immigration officers of police of the bordering districts of Assam are alerted to keep sharp vigil to prevent trans-border trafficking. Over the years, Assam has become a source area for trafficking of children and women who are forced to work as domestic helps, are often exploited, abused, even pushed into the flesh trade or simply remain untraced. Placement Agencies are one of the main means used by traffickers to transport people across different states and countries. Legislation is required in Assam to make it mandatory for placement agencies and their agents operating in the state to get registered with the government to ensure better monitoring of these agencies. The government should promulgate a law to regulate placement agencies to check human trafficking. The current absence of such an act in Assam has made it difficult to ascertain the exact number of placement agencies and their agents operating in the state. The menace of human trafficking cannot be controlled unless the NGOâ€™s working in this field and the Government agencies work sincerely towards social and economical development of the downtrodden. Unless the root causes that make people from poor and marginalized families vulnerable to trafficking are addressed, there is little chance of the menace being curbed. Police on the other hand should be vigilant at the ground level. It goes without saying that, the Assam government needs to buckle up as it is high time that this issue receives the focus and attention it deserves. Proper and active collaboration with non Governmental agencies as well as other state governments is definitely a required course of action for our government. Only when all the members of the society cooperate with the government, the evil of human trafficking can be controlled and mitigated suitably. Human trafficking is the one of the worst crime facing humanity.</p>

            <p>This has to be the worst blog post I have ever read. It simply makes no sense. You start off by talking
                about space or something, then you randomly start babbling about cupcakes, and you end off with random
                fish names.</p>

            <p>Don't listen to this guy, any blog with the categories 'dinosaurs, spaceships, fried foods, wild animals,
                alien abductions, business casual, robots, and fireworks' has true potential.</p>
