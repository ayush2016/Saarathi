            <hr>
            <p class="lead">I had big dreams in life. A correction I still have big dreams, can’t I see them? Am I a less human today? Or am I some “impure girl” what the ladies in society call me? I know I have already lost the right to marry and live a respectable wedded life with two small kids playing in my drawing room. Ahh! Why do even I still remember that part of my dream? But I dreamt of being decorated with a maroon embroidered saree, colourful bangles and blushing smile. I did. It's more than butchered now. With every scar I received in my vaginal region, every time I was pinned down on that dirty bed of brothel, my all the fantasies for a happy prosperous life got bewildered. I was just 12 when I attended my first client or should say when I was practically and forcefully imparted sex education. I had not even reached my puberty then, I was the clean paper where they wrote their wild unfulfilled desires. I don’t blame them completely for making me conceive several times followed by the unhygienic abortions I had to undergo in my teens, after all, they paid for it to my pimp, so why will they allow me to negotiate for the use of protection. But I know and I accept no one would want me today to be a mother to his child after so many fetuses being killed in my womb. I know I deserved all that a normal girl would deserve but reality is today I stand snatched away from the basic rights of life. I still dream because my dreams were not limited to just marriage and family, I a girl from small—humble village aspired to be an independent citizen of our country. I went primary school walking a distance of five kilometres per day when I was 11. Schoolmaster said if I pass 5th grade with distinction they would recommend me to the school where big girls study. I did my exams well but before I could get results I was just picked like many other girls from our village, they picked me up too. I haven’t decided then what I wanted to choose as my profession but I was firmly determined to stand on my own feet. The dreams that 11-year girl carried in her eyes are yet not broken. Why should I just engage myself in handicraft, tailoring or some other work which I can do staying in a rehabilitation centre? Why should I limit my potentials and dreams when I know if I am taught and trained I could emerge as a skillful person. I want to study, do Bachelors and then get a job for myself. But the question is which reputed university would admit a girl who was once a prostitute. Even if some NGO pushes me to any college will the fellow mates greet me with a similar smile with which they greet each other? Will a girl come from some reputed background share room with me in a hostel? Will her mother not argue with the warden to shift her daughter with a normal girl. Will I not be misunderstood when I try to do friendship with men? Will a company give a job to a girl who once served sex? Will my resume never be maligned with the job experience I carry? ???? Lots and lots of questions I have today. As per crime branch report I am rescued survivor of Human trafficking today, but who will rescue me with the echoes of all these questions? Shall my dreams too deserve to die in the echo of the questions? Ask yourself once Am I really rescued ? </p>

            <p>This has to be the worst blog post I have ever read. It simply makes no sense. You start off by talking
                about space or something, then you randomly start babbling about cupcakes, and you end off with random
                fish names.</p>

            <p>Don't listen to this guy, any blog with the categories 'dinosaurs, spaceships, fried foods, wild animals,
                alien abductions, business casual, robots, and fireworks' has true potential.</p>
