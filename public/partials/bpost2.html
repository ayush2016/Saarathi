            <p class="lead">You earn well, dine and live well. You sleep soundly, dreaming of a better tomorrow, for yourself and hopefully for others too. You know it's a corrupt living, each day a race to score your dominion over another. You can see some are left way down on the ladder, but you possibly can't imagine their world. You got your own race to run. When you scroll through the violence of the world streaming live on your phone, sometimes you let out a silent prayer as well for those unfortunate. 'Someone should help them!', you murmur to know one. 'But what can I do?' And at this juncture, you pause but never stop. You know you mean well but are just helpless. So, you keep scrolling. 'Nothing that I can do.' Unfortunately, most of us think the same. If only we could imagine better! There are millions of children today (if you can think how big is that number,) who are enslaved by the worst of us monsters, stripped of their freedom, living each day as if a punishment. Physically tortured and mentally broken, some of them have run out of tears, most of them have run out of hope. Trained as mere dolls for the lust of men, do you think they can imagine better? Look around and pay attention, this is all happening now, in today's time more than ever before. If you pray for a better world, then start from yourself. If you keep a blindfold, then your prayers won't help. You can help them. Be vigilant of such crimes around you, have the courage to act and inform the authorities. Show compassion and love for those who have suffered. Accept the exploited in your society and help them recover in a happier person. Every little step counts. Some say, if you can provide hope to one life, you can save the world.</p>

            <p>This has to be the worst blog post I have ever read. It simply makes no sense. You start off by talking
                about space or something, then you randomly start babbling about cupcakes, and you end off with random
                fish names.</p>

            <p>Don't listen to this guy, any blog with the categories 'dinosaurs, spaceships, fried foods, wild animals,
                alien abductions, business casual, robots, and fireworks' has true potential.</p>
